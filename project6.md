## Project description

This project was to build a litely functional webite which showcases student abilities to create a finish UI that incorpoated HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript in the design. The is comprised of several of the assignments and task created over the course of the semester. 

## How to run the program

How to run the project.

```bash
http://rodoliver.atwebpages.com/finalproject/ROWebDesigns.htm
```

The application doesn't need compiliing but can be run by going tothe webpages link above. To be able to recreate the assignment you would need to go to https://webfreehosting.net/login.php to create an account for a free domain. Fron the domain you will be able to add all the file to the domain to be able display them online. This process is similar to adding the application on a webserver. For instructions please feel free to contact me.

## UI Design

The application is just a simple desgin that allow the user to view basic function on how a website works. This site allows for the user to use buttons, checkboxes, clickable thumbnails, and radio buttons to understand how the website respond to user interaction.

Website landing page on load (see Fig 1), displays the user interface with interactive links for the user to be able to navigate the site, and see how the clickable items and links respond. The Recreation pages just to display code style and design, as well as to showcase the use of a different nav bars style (see Fig 2).The Entertainment page showcases the use of a radio button style form that allows a user to make a selection for movie tickets with the ability to reset the form for the user (see Fig 3). The Fitness site showcases the use of tables and rows within a website. The site also showcases the styling that is used for alternating colors on rows (see Fig 4).

## 3. Additional Considerations

As a result of what I have learned over the years, I have continued to work towards building my skillset through continual development and training by learning applications such as *Power Query & Power BI, MySQL, ect*). Below is an example of a example site I started working on in 2017 for an automotive maintenance site based on a class project using PHP. The page is only the login page and the code for the vehicle logs can be shared if requested.
