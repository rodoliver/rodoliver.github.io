Personal Porject in Progress
===============

-   **Language(s): *HTML5, PHP* 

## Project description

This project is an extension of a class project from my PHP & MySQL class. The purpose of the project is to develop an online vehicle maintence tracker that allow the user to catalog each vehicle't make, model, year, and option, the types of maintenance needed and the types of maintenance done over the years. It is to also to keep a record of the type of fuel used it's cost at the time and it's consumption, to help determine if there are performance issues due to the change is fuel consumptions.

## How to run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

```bash
The user user will need to setup a database for MySQL to be able to input the table containing the vehicle information.
```

## UI Design

The application allows the user to login into the webiste with a unique username and password to acces the maintenance dashboard. The dashboard will provide the user with an interface that allows them to choose to add an additional user to the account, add a vehicle, the type of maintenance, the type of fuel and its cost and consumption, and the ability to update the user and vehicle information. The application is to also provide important information in the drop-down in the body of the page, such as recent recalls, common trouble codes, and important reminds and key maintenance tips, such as *how to prepare you vehicle for the winter*.

The screenshots below will provide a visual representation of a few functions. (see Fig 1), the website login page, is the first screen that the user sees when they navigate to the page. The page is simple for the fact that it is application expected to be updated according user needs. The second example is the user interface that allows the users to select from several options in the nav bar, the first being button for adding a new user (see Fig 2). The remaining examples are the models used to update the users, vehciles, and feuel information. Unfortunately the database is not attached at this moment and cannot display the table for the records in the database. This documentation will be updated later with screeshots of those examples. (see Figs 3 - Fig 8).
